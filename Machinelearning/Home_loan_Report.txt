==========================================================
            EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
                    LOAN DATASET
==========================================================

1. DATA OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------------------
The dataset contains 614 loan applications comprising both numerical
and categorical variables. The target variable (Loan_Status) indicates
whether a loan was approved or rejected.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. DATA STRUCTURE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------
The dataset contains 614 rows and 12 columns representing demographic,
financial, and credit-related attributes.

| Column             | Non-Null | Data Type | Description |
|--------------------|-----------|------------|--------------|

| LoanAmount         | 592       | float64    | Loan amount (in thousands) |
| Loan_Amount_Term   | 600       | float64    | Loan repayment term (months) |
| Credit_History     | 564       | float64    | Credit history (1=good, 0=bad) |
| Property_Area      | 614       | object     | Urban/Semiurban/Rural |
| Loan_Status        | 614       | object     | Target variable (Y/N) |

Key Observations:
- 7 categorical and 5 numerical variables.
- Missing values exist across several columns.
- No duplicates or incorrect data types observed.
- Target variable: Loan_Status (Y/N).

----------------------------------------------------------
3. MISSING VALUES
----------------------------------------------------------
| Column            | Missing Count |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Gender            | 13             |
| Married           | 3              |
| Dependents        | 15             |
| Self_Employed     | 32             |
| LoanAmount        | 22             |
| Loan_Amount_Term  | 14             |
| Credit_History    | 50             |

----------------------------------------------------------
4. DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION
----------------------------------------------------------
- Missing categorical variables were imputed using the MODE.
- Missing numerical variables were imputed using the MEDIAN.
- Outliers were identified and clipped using the IQR method.

NOTE:
Even after outlier clipping, numerical columns (ApplicantIncome
and CoapplicantIncome) remained highly skewed. This suggests deep
income disparities rather than random anomalies.
A log or Box-Cox transformation is recommended.

----------------------------------------------------------
5. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS (NUMERICAL FEATURES)
----------------------------------------------------------
| Feature           | Mean     | Std Dev | Min | 25%   | 50%   | 75%   | Max   |
|-------------------|----------|---------|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| ApplicantIncome   | 5403.46  | 6109.04 | 150 | 2877.5| 3812.5| 5795  | 81000 |
| CoapplicantIncome | 1621.25  | 2926.25 | 0   | 0     | 1188.5| 2297.2| 41667 |
| LoanAmount        | 145.75   | 84.11   | 9   | 100.25| 128   | 164.75| 700   |

Observations:
- High standard deviation indicates large income disparities.
- Applicant incomes are higher than co-applicants.
- Loan amounts vary widely across applicants.

----------------------------------------------------------
6. CATEGORICAL VARIABLE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------

Gender:
- Male: 502 (81.76%)
- Female: 112 (18.24%)
Observation: Dataset is male-dominated.

Married:
- Yes: 401 (65.31%)
- No: 213 (34.69%)
Observation: Majority are married, possibly joint applications.

Education:
- Graduate: 480 (78.18%)
- Not Graduate: 134 (21.82%)
Observation: Most applicants are graduates.

Self_Employed:
- No: 532 (86.64%)
- Yes: 82 (13.36%)
Observation: Majority are salaried employees.

Credit_History:
- Good: 525 (85.50%)
- Bad: 89 (14.50%)
Observation: Strong credit history among most applicants.

Property_Area:
- Semiurban: 233 (37.95%)
- Urban: 202 (32.90%)
- Rural: 179 (29.15%)
Observation: Semiurban and urban applicants dominate.

Dependents:
- 0: 360 (58.63%)
- 1: 102 (16.61%)
- 2: 101 (16.45%)
- 3+: 51 (8.31%)
Observation: Most applicants have no dependents.

Key Insights:
- Dataset is graduate-heavy and male-dominated.
- Over 85% have good credit history, which could bias models.
- Urban and semiurban areas represent most applications.

----------------------------------------------------------
7. UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS (NUMERICAL FEATURES)
----------------------------------------------------------
| Feature           | Skewness | Kurtosis | Observation |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|
| ApplicantIncome   | 1.040    | 0.126     | Highly right-skewed |
| CoapplicantIncome | 1.082    | 0.231     | Highly skewed |
| LoanAmount        | 0.684    | 0.112     | Moderately skewed |

Outlier Counts:
- ApplicantIncome → 50
- CoapplicantIncome → 18
- LoanAmount → 41

Even after treatment, skewness persists — likely due to genuine
differences in financial capacity among applicants.

----------------------------------------------------------
8. BIVARIATE ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------------------------

a. ApplicantIncome vs LoanAmount
   - Correlation: 0.558
   - p-value: 0.000
   → Strong positive correlation: higher income, higher loan amount.

b. ApplicantIncome vs CoapplicantIncome
   - Correlation: -0.229
   - p-value: 0.000
   → Negative correlation: high-income applicants often have
     low or no co-applicant income.

c. CoapplicantIncome vs LoanAmount
   - Correlation: 0.265
   - p-value: 0.000
   → Weak-to-moderate positive correlation.

----------------------------------------------------------
9. FEATURE CORRELATION SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------
| Feature            | Corr. with Loan_Status |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| LoanAmount         | -0.047                 |
| Loan_Amount_Term   | -0.021                 |
| CoapplicantIncome  | 0.012                  |
| ApplicantIncome    | -0.000                 |

Observation:
Weak correlations — income and loan size alone do not determine approval.

Feature Engineering Suggestions:
- Total_Income = ApplicantIncome + CoapplicantIncome
- EMI = LoanAmount / Loan_Amount_Term
- Income_to_Loan_Ratio = Total_Income / LoanAmount

----------------------------------------------------------
10. TARGET VARIABLE DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------------------------------------
Approved loans are more than twice as many as declined loans.
This shows a class imbalance, which can bias predictions.

Possible Solutions:
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)
- Undersampling
- Class weighting during model training

----------------------------------------------------------
11. FURTHER PREPROCESSING RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------

| Step | Recommended Action | Rationale |
|------|--------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Handle Remaining Skewness | Apply log or Box-Cox transformation to skewed columns (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount). |
| 2 | Encode Categorical Variables | Label encode binary features (Gender, Married, Education) and one-hot encode multi-category features (Property_Area, Dependents). |
| 3 | Normalize or Scale Numerical Features | Use StandardScaler or RobustScaler to avoid magnitude bias. |
| 4 | Feature Engineering | Add Total_Income, EMI, and Income_to_Loan_Ratio for better representation of repayment ability. |
| 5 | Handle Target Encoding | Convert Loan_Status → {Y:1, N:0}. |
| 6 | Class Imbalance Treatment | Apply SMOTE or class weighting to reduce bias toward approvals. |
| 7 | Feature Selection | After encoding, check feature importance using correlation or tree-based models. |

----------------------------------------------------------
12. SUMMARY INSIGHTS
----------------------------------------------------------
- The dataset is clean and structured but requires transformation
  to handle skewness and imbalance.
- Strong predictors: Credit_History, Property_Area, Education.
- Recommended: Scaling, encoding, and feature engineering before modeling.
- Despite outlier clipping, skewness persists, suggesting real income
  disparity among applicants.
